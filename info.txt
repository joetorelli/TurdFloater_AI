Sure, I can help you with that. Here's an outline of the code:

Initialize the ESP32 and necessary libraries.
Initialize the pump relay and flow switch pins.
Initialize the INA3221 to read current from the pump motor.
Define the turn-on and turn-off levels for the tank.
Define the pump control logic and flow switch debounce logic.
Define the functions to read the tank level and flow switch status.
In the main loop, read the tank level and turn on the pump if necessary.
After 1 second, read the flow switch status and turn off the pump if there is no flow.
Continue pumping until either the tank is empty or the turn-off level is reached.
Print messages when the pump is turned on, turned off, or when there is no flow.

Define constants for the water level sensor, pump, and flow switch pins.
Include the necessary libraries for the INA3221, Ticker, and Serial communication.
Initialize the INA3221 and set its shunt values.
Set up a Ticker to monitor the water level every 1 second and adjust the pump accordingly.
Create a function to read the water level sensor using the INA3221.
Create a function to turn on the pump when the water level is above the turn-on level.
Create a function to turn off the pump when the water level is below the turn-off level or there is no flow detected.
Create a function to handle the flow switch by setting a flag when flow is detected.
Add the necessary code in the Ticker function to call the pump control and flow switch functions.
Set up the Serial communication to display information about the water level and pump status.
Once the waonce the water level reaches the turn on level, turn on the pump to drain the tank.
To turn on the pump, we can simply set the pump pin to HIGH. Let's assume that the pump is connected to pin 13.

Note that we are setting the pumpOn variable to true. We will use this variable later on to determine when to turn off the pump.

Now that the pump is turned on, we need to monitor the water flow to make sure that the pump is actually draining the tank.
 We will do this in step 5.
Now that we have the pump turning on and off based on the water level in the tank, we need to test for water flow. 
We can use a flow switch for this.

Connect the flow switch to the ESP32 board. We will use pin 4 for the flow switch input.

We will use the Ticker library to delay reading the flow switch for the first second after the pump has been turned on. 
This gives the pump enough time to start draining the tank before we test for water flow.

Create a Ticker object called flowSwitchTicker that calls a function handleFlowSwitch every 100ms. We will start the 
Ticker when the pump is turned on.

In handleFlowSwitch, read the state of the flow switch input pin. If it is HIGH, then there is water flow. If it is LOW, 
then there is no water flow.

If there is no water flow and the pump is on, turn off the pump and print a warning message.

If there is water flow, keep the pump on until there is no water flow or the turn off level has been reached.

When the turn off level has been reached, turn off the pump and print a message that the tank is empty.

Repeat from step 2.
